# Executive Summary
Motor Trend, an automobile trend magazine is interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) outcome. In this project, we will analyze the mtcars dataset from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine to answer the following questions:

    Is an automatic or manual transmission better for miles per gallon (MPG)?
    How different is the MPG between automatic and manual transmissions?

Using simple linear regression analysis, we determine that there is a signficant difference between the mean MPG for automatic and manual transmission cars. Manual transmissions achieve a higher value of MPG compared to automatic transmission. This increase is approximately 2.1 MPG when switching from an automatic transmission to a manual one, with the weight, horsepower and discplacement held constant.

Exploratory analysis and visualizations are located in the Appendix to this document.

# Exploratory data analysis
```{r}
library(ggplot2) #for plots
#Lets have a look at our dataset
data(mtcars) #loading the dataset
head(mtcars) #viewing first few rows of the dataset
```
```{r}
# Transform certain variables into factors
mtcars$cyl  <- factor(mtcars$cyl)
mtcars$vs   <- factor(mtcars$vs)
mtcars$gear <- factor(mtcars$gear)
mtcars$carb <- factor(mtcars$carb)
mtcars$am   <- factor(mtcars$am,labels=c("Automatic","Manual"))
```
To help us understand the data, we build exploratory plots. Appendix - Plot 1, shows there is a definite impact on MPG by transmission with Automatic transmissions having a lower MPG.

# Regression Analysis
Weâ€™ve visually seen that automatic is better for MPG, but we will now quantify his difference.
```{r}
aggregate(mpg~am, data = mtcars, mean)
```
Thus we hypothesize that automatic cars have an MPG 7.25 lower than manual cars. To determine if this is a significant difference, we use a t-test.
```{r}
D_automatic <- mtcars[mtcars$am == "Automatic",]
D_manual <- mtcars[mtcars$am == "Manual",]
t.test(D_automatic$mpg, D_manual$mpg)
```
The p-value is 0.001374, thus we can state this is a significant difference. Now to quantify this.
```{r}
init <- lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)
summary(init)
```
This shows us that the average MPG for automatic is 17.1 MPG, while manual is 7.2 MPG higher. The R2

value is 0.36 thus telling us this model only explains us 36% of the variance. As a result, we need to build a multivariate linear regression.

The new model will use the other variables to make it more accurate. We explore the other variable via a pairs plot (Appendix - Plot 2) to see how all the variables correlate with mpg. From this we see that cyl, disp, hp, wt have the strongest correlation with mpg. We build a new model using these variables and compare them to the initial model with the anova function.
```{r}
betterFit <- lm(mpg~am + cyl + disp + hp + wt, data = mtcars)
anova(init, betterFit)
```
This results in a p-value of 8.637e-08, and we can claim the betterFit model is significantly better than our init simple model. We double-check the residuals for non-normality (Appendix - Plot 3) and can see they are all normally distributed and homoskedastic.
```{r}
summary(betterFit)
```
The model explains 86.64% of the variance and as a result, cyl, disp, hp, wt did affect the correlation between mpg and am. Thus, we can say the difference between automatic and manual transmissions is 1.81 MPG.
